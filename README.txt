VK Widget Oxy Theme OpenCart Mod
================================

VK Widget Oxy Theme OpenCart Mod adds VKontakte (VK.com) configurable widget and social button to social blocks of the Oxy OpenCart theme. It adds VKontakte widget to the side block with Twitter and Facebook widgets. The VK widget is made configurable from the Oxy admin settings along with Oxy's own Facebook and Twitter widgets. Also, it adds a social VKontakte button to the block of other similar buttons at the bottom of the page.

Note: I'm in no way affiliated with the Oxy theme itself, it is commercial product and can be bought from "ThemeForest" catalog.

Installation
============

Copy the 'catalog' and 'vqmod' folder to your OpenCart installation directory as usually. If you're using vqModManager or any similar tool, then ensure that after copying the 'VK Widget For Oxy Theme Mod' vQmod is enabled.
After the above, the widget and button can be enabled and configured further from Oxy setting is OpenCart admin interface along with other Oxy Theme's own social widgets.
Since, everyone changes their CSS in different ways to customize the theme, the CSS rules are not modified automatically. You need to modify the CSS yourself to fit your setup. See 'Sample_CSS_for_vk_widget_oxy_mod.txt' for main CSS snippets, that may be used as the basis for your modifications.
'catalog/view/theme/oxy/image' contains several images so you might want to change the default 'vkontakte_lb_l.png' and 'vkontakte_lb_r.png'.
